# Privacy Policy — TradeMate
Last updated: 22 September 2025

*Web version:* https://tradematequotes.com/privacy

TradeMate (“we”, “us”) provides tools for tradespeople to manage jobs, quotes and invoices. This policy explains how we handle personal data.

## Data we process
- *Account data*: profile details and login information.
- *App data*: jobs, quotes, invoices, and attachments you upload.
- *Device data*: app version, device model, crash and performance logs.
- *Payments*:
  - *In-app purchases* are handled directly by *Google Play* or *Apple App Store*. We do not receive or store your card details.
  - *Website purchases* (e.g. subscriptions via our site) are processed by *Stripe*; we receive only references, not full card details.
- *Location*: only if you grant OS permission, and only for features that need it (e.g., job addresses).

## Why we use your data (lawful bases)
- *Provide the app* and its core features (contract).
- *Improve safety, performance and support* (legitimate interests).
- *Payments and billing* (contract and legal obligation).
- *Optional features and messages* (consent).

## Sharing
We use trusted processors to run the app:
- *Supabase* for hosting, database, storage, and authentication.
- *Stripe* for payments on our website.
- *Google Play* and *Apple App Store* for in-app purchases.
- *Crash/analytics providers* (where used) to improve stability.

They act on our instructions. We don’t sell your data.

## International transfers
Where data leaves the UK/EEA, we rely on safeguards such as the UK IDTA or EU SCCs.

## Retention
We keep data while you have an account and for a reasonable period afterward for legal/operational purposes, then delete or anonymise it.

## Your rights (UK GDPR)
You can:
- Access, correct, or delete your data — including full account deletion via *Support* in the app.
- Object to or restrict processing in certain cases.
- Exercise *data portability*.
- *Withdraw consent* for non-essential messages/cookies and OS-level location permissions.
- Complain to the *UK ICO* if you’re unhappy with our response.

We will respond to rights requests *within one month, as required by law. To exercise rights, use **Support* in the app.

## Children
TradeMate is *not intended for children under 16*.

## Changes
We’ll update this policy as needed and show you the new version in the app.

## Contact
Use *Support* in the app to message us. We’ll reply there.
